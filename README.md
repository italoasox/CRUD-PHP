A CRUD project is a software application that performs the four basic operations of persistent storage:

Create: Add new records/data (e.g., register a new user).

Read: Retrieve or view existing data (e.g., display user details).

Update: Modify existing data (e.g., edit user information).

Delete: Remove data (e.g., delete a user account).

In my project, I built a CRUD system using PHP and MySQL. The application manages user data through a web interface. Hereâ€™s how it works:

On the Create page, users can fill out a form to register a new user. The data is sent to the server and stored in the MySQL database.

The Read function displays a list of all users and allows viewing details of a specific user.

The Update function allows editing user data. A form is pre-filled with current information, and changes are saved to the database.

The Delete function lets users remove records, with a confirmation step to avoid accidental deletions.

I applied HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for the front-end, and used PHP with MySQLi for server-side processing and database interaction.

Additionally, I followed good practices like input validation, error handling, and user feedback messages. This project helped me understand full-stack development concepts and how to connect the front-end to a back-end database.
